Allclean.sh script cleans the directories of all five p?? subcases 
(removes time folders, postProcessing and log file)

Allrun_Df???_f???.sh copies Df_??? and porosityProperties_??? to 5 subcases 
and runs all of them in the backround (porousGasificationFoam > log&) 
with those Df_??? and f_??? set for Darcy and Forcheimer coeffs.

Alllog.sh tails all 5 log files and the user can easily see the p_min and p_max. 
Pressure drop equals almost exactly to p_max-p_min; the error can be neglected.

Example exectuion:
  ./Allclean.sh
  ./Allrun_Df2.56e+10_f3.21e+6.sh
  ./Alllog_pmin
